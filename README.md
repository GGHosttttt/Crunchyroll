# Crunchyroll
Hello, this is just a replicate of Crunchyroll website which is a site for watching anime, and i think is a great layout for practice. It's a simple layout using Html and Css, and it's a great time to put many library such as animate css, hover library and AOS library. I hope this code will be useful to you and motivate yourself to code more.
